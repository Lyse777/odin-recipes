    <h3>Ingredients</h3>    
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (for garnish)</li>  
    </ul>   
    <h3>Steps</h3>  
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a large baking dish.</li>
        <li>Cook the elbow macaroni according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the flour and cook for about 1-2 minutes until it forms a roux.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the milk and heavy cream, ensuring there are no lumps. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses to the sauce. Stir until all the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li>Combine the cooked macaroni with the cheese sauce, ensuring all pasta is well coated.</li>
        <li>Pour the macaroni and cheese mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the panko breadcrumbs evenly over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired.</li>  
    </ol>
